# A Unified Parameterized Post-Einsteinian Framework for Dark Matter and Quantum Vacuum Effects in Black-Hole and GW Observables

## Authors
Giorgio Maria (Independent Researcher)

## Description
This repository contains the LaTeX source for the scientific article proposing 
a unified parameterized post-Einsteinian (ppE) formalism for measurable 
dark-matter and quantum-vacuum effects in black-hole mass evolution and 
gravitational-wave signals.

The framework introduces:
- A dimensionless black-hole mass-balance equation,
- ppE-style phase corrections `(β_DM, n_DM)`,
- A gravitational-decoherence parameterization `(Γ~, m_DM)`.

These parameters are measurable with next-generation detectors such as LISA and 
Einstein Telescope.
